# Self-Driving Car in GTA using PyTorch , crazy right? probably not that crazy

![Self-Driving Car Program](README.png)


This is a fully-featured **self-driving car program** built using **PyTorch** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The system is capable of controlling a car's movement autonomously by processing input data from the game environment.


## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use the https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet to allow the logging script to run in order to collect output speed of the vehicle
